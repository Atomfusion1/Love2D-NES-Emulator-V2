# Love2D-NES-Emulator-V2
 Trial Emulator for Love2d and Lua Second Round
 NES Emulator updates here. Revamped the CPU and APU and tidied up the PPU, though it could use more love. Made a bunch of tweaks and fixes too. Picking a rom? Just hit ` or use Start+Select on your joystick; all roms are in the Rom folder. 
 Saving a game state? Tap 123. For loading saved states, 789's your key and you'll find them in the RomSaves folder. 
 Hit v = max emulator speed great for FF1 Battles 
 For debugging or extra commands, press L.

Current roms now get saved in nesEmuState.txt. 
Implemented mappers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, though they're mostly behaving, no guarantees! 
80-90% of games are playable, but expect a few display bugs and issues.

Might be the final stage of the emulator, I'm happy with it and it's surpassed expectations. Been a fun ride.
